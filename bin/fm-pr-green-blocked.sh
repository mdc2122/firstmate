# Read-only probe: is one open GitHub pull request green but unable to merge?
# bin/fm-watch.sh runs it beside an armed merge poll and owns the 30-minute
# episode timer and the single wake per episode; this script only reads the
# forge once and classifies what it saw.
#
# Prints exactly one line:
#   blocked <head-sha> <code> <reason>
#                     every check is green (bin/fm-pr-lib.sh's
#                     fm_pr_github_checks_not_green, the check-green rule
#                     bin/fm-pr-merge.sh also gates on), every check the base
#                     branch requires has reported (bin/fm-pr-lib.sh's
#                     fm_pr_github_read_required_contexts; only this probe
#                     reads it), the pull request is not waiting in the base
#                     branch's merge queue (bin/fm-pr-lib.sh's
#                     fm_pr_github_read_outcome_with_gh, the read
#                     bin/fm-pr-merge.sh makes after a merge attempt), and it
#                     still cannot merge: a draft, conflicts with its base, a
#                     branch behind its base, or base-branch protection such as
#                     a missing review; <head-sha> is the head commit the
#                     reading describes, so the caller can tell a re-pushed
#                     head that is blocked again from the same stuck head;
#                     <code> is one stable word naming the blocking reason
#                     (draft, conflict, behind, protection) for callers that
#                     act on one reason, and <reason> is its prose
#   clear             the stuck condition does not hold: the pull request is
#                     merged or closed, a check is red or pending, a required
#                     check has not reported (its CI has not passed, however
#                     green the rollup looks), it is waiting in the base
#                     branch's merge queue (GitHub reports a queued pull
#                     request as BLOCKED while nothing is stuck), or GitHub
#                     reports it mergeable
# and nothing when the answer is unknown: a failed read, an unreadable payload,
# a missing head commit or base branch, an unreadable merge-queue state or
# required-check source, a missing jq, or mergeability GitHub has not computed
# yet. The caller keeps its episode unchanged on silence, so a flaky read
# neither opens nor ends one.
# It never merges, updates a branch, or writes anything. GitLab and Gerrit are
# not probed: this is GitHub-only.
