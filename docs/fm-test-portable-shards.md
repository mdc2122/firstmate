# Firstmate portable test shards

`bin/fm-test-run.sh` owns portable lane composition and execution.
`bin/fm-test-isolation-proof.sh` owns the proven-isolated candidate set.

## Verification inputs

Balance hints come from serial runs of the real lanes on `ubuntu-latest`.
The concurrent isolation proof in [fm-test-isolation-proof.md](fm-test-isolation-proof.md) establishes concurrency safety, not serial CI duration.
Local timings are not interchangeable with CI timings: platform and machine load can affect each script differently and change their relative weights.

The retained hints are the slowest completed value each script reached across six CI runs on 2026-09-10: [34459949083](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/actions/runs/34459949083), [34460760299](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/actions/runs/34460760299), [34462530836](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/actions/runs/34462530836), [34462758357](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/actions/runs/34462758357), [34466966385](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/actions/runs/34466966385), and [34470382458](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/actions/runs/34470382458).
Shard 2 completed in all six, so its scripts come from the uploaded `fm-test-timing-portable-parallel-2` artifacts.
Shard 1 was cancelled at its job cap in five of the six, so its scripts come from the `FM_TEST_END duration_ms=` markers in each cancelled job's log, which record every script that finished before the cancellation, plus the one complete `fm-test-timing-portable-parallel-1` artifact from run 34462758357.
Observed maxima provide conservative packing weights, not an upper bound on future durations.

The measurements cover all 24 candidates, with six samples per script except:

| Samples | Scripts |
|---:|---|
| 4 | `tests/fm-lint.test.sh` |
| 3 | `tests/fm-pi-primary-types.test.sh`, `tests/fm-review-diff.test.sh` |
| 1 | `tests/fm-brief.test.sh`, `tests/fm-transition-lib.test.sh` |

The two scripts with one sample are the tail of shard 1 that only the complete run reached.
Collect completed per-script measurements for every member before calculating a split.
A cancelled lane's elapsed duration is only a lower bound; its unfinished scripts have no completed duration for that invocation.
The complete historical run supplies tail-script hints, not a completion time for any later cancelled invocation or for the rebalanced jobs.

## Parallel lanes

The two parallel lanes use longest-processing-time assignment over those hints.
[`bin/fm-test-run.sh`](../bin/fm-test-run.sh) holds the duration values in `portable_parallel_weight_hints` and the ordered memberships and lane-specific prerequisite constraints beside `list_portable_parallel_1` and `list_portable_parallel_2`.
Read the derived packing estimates with that runner's `--check-coverage`; its header and `--help` own the output fields and the selection-specific `--list-scheduled` weight rules.
The largest individual hint sets a lower bound on the estimated duration of any split, regardless of how evenly the remaining work is assigned.
The CI cap and its rationale are owned by [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](../.github/workflows/ci.yml).

[`tests/fm-test-run.test.sh`](../tests/fm-test-run.test.sh), in `test_portable_parallel_lanes_stay_duration_balanced`, requires every parallel member to have a hint and the lane sums to differ by no more than five percent of the larger sum.
Its scheduling regressions also check stored parallel lane order and preserve serial-weight scheduling for other selections.
These checks do not detect a script outgrowing an existing hint or establish measured job headroom.
Refresh `portable_parallel_weight_hints` with the slowest completed `duration_ms` per script from several green CI runs' `fm-test-timing-portable-parallel-*` artifacts whenever the parallel set gains scripts or a member grows materially.

## Portable serial remainder

`portable-serial` includes every `tests/*.test.sh` that is neither proven-isolated nor `real-herdr-gated`.
It keeps watcher, lock, AFK, real tmux, daemon, secondmate lifecycle, bootstrap, the `live-harness-optin` family, GUI-backend, and other unproven work serial.
Membership is derived rather than enumerated, so a newly added test lands here by default.

## Portable serial CI shards

On green CI run [30725985757](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/actions/runs/30725985757), that remainder accumulated 19m04s of script time against a 20-minute job timeout.
On [PR 1495](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/pull/1495), its main step ran about 19m51s before the job was cancelled at that boundary.
`portable-serial-<k>of<n>` splits it across `n` separate CI runners.
Each shard is still strictly serial in itself, and separate runners mean no two of these stateful scripts ever share a machine, so the split needs no concurrency isolation proof.

`bin/fm-test-run.sh` owns `n` and refuses any lane whose `of<n>` disagrees with it.
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` derives the same `n` from `strategy.job-total` rather than a literal, so changing the shard count in either file without the other fails the lane loudly instead of leaving part of the required suite unrun.

Assignment is longest-processing-time bin packing over per-script duration hints embedded in `bin/fm-test-run.sh`.
The embedded hints include the slowest measurements retained from the `fm-test-timing-portable-serial-*` artifacts of three green CI runs on 2026-09-01, [33558082172](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/actions/runs/33558082172), [33523597838](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/actions/runs/33523597838), and [33463326167](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/actions/runs/33463326167), the completed-script measurements from [run 34342484144](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/actions/runs/34342484144), the 5121 ms native-Windows focused runner measurement for `tests/fm-pi-windows-shell-invocation.test.sh` from 2026-09-06T21:02Z, plus the 27271 ms local serial measurement for `tests/fm-queue-zero.test.sh` from 2026-10-01 and the 22511 ms local serial measurement for `tests/fm-stow-trigger.test.sh` from 2026-10-06 until green CI artifacts replace them, plus the `tests/fm-omp-branch.test.sh` and `tests/fm-omp-branch-live-e2e.test.sh` measurements from the green serial shards of run [37175959873](https://github.com/mdc2122/firstmate/actions/runs/37175959873).
The `tests/fm-far-holds.test.sh` (7417 ms) and `tests/fm-followup-ledger.test.sh` (9640 ms) hints come from the green serial shards 4 and 1, respectively, of run [37377110375](https://github.com/mdc2122/firstmate/actions/runs/37377110375); both scripts completed successfully without retries or timeouts.
Taking the slowest of several CI runs rather than a single run keeps the balance honest on a slow runner.
A script with no hint gets the conservative `PORTABLE_SERIAL_DEFAULT_WEIGHT_MS` default.
Hints only affect balance: the coverage guard keeps the partition complete and disjoint whatever they say, so a stale hint costs a slower shard rather than lost coverage.
Balance is still worth keeping current, because enough unmeasured scripts let one shard carry more than twice another shard's real work and reach the job cap while another runner sits idle.
That is not hypothetical: by 2026-09-01 the lane had grown from 116 to 139 scripts and from ~42 to ~63 minutes, 17 scripts were still unmeasured, and several hints were low by 2-5x, so shard 3 of 4 ran 17-20 minutes against its 20-minute cap while shard 1 ran 11.5 minutes and run [33574154856](https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate/actions/runs/33574154856) timed out seconds after a passing test.
`bin/fm-test-run.sh --check-coverage` now reports the unmeasured share as `serial_unhinted=` and refuses past `PORTABLE_SERIAL_MAX_UNHINTED_PERCENT`, so hint drift fails the coverage guard instead of silently pushing one shard into its job cap.
Refresh the hints whenever the serial lane gains scripts, rather than waiting for that bound to trip.

`bin/fm-test-run.sh` owns the per-shard packing, so its `--check-coverage` output is the current account of lane size, shard composition, and balance rather than a copied table.
Run 34342484144 observed a shard reach about 20 minutes of passing work; by 2026-09-29 the slowest shard ran past 27 minutes, so the job cap keeps hang-tripwire margin for job setup and runner-speed spread; the [Timeouts](#timeouts) section points to the current bound.

The single longest script, `tests/fm-watch-triage.test.sh` at 262626 ms, is the floor for any shard count.

Refresh the CI-derived hints by downloading the per-shard timing artifacts from several green CI runs and replacing the `portable_serial_weight_hints` table in `bin/fm-test-run.sh` with the slowest measured `duration_ms` per `path`:

```sh
for run in <run-id> <run-id> <run-id>; do
  gh run download "$run" -R kunchenguid/firstmate --pattern 'fm-test-timing-portable-serial-*' -D "/tmp/fm-serial/$run"
done
jq -r '.scripts[] | [.path, .duration_ms] | @tsv' /tmp/fm-serial/*/*.json \
  | awk -F'\t' '$2 > m[$1] { m[$1] = $2 } END { for (p in m) print p, m[p] }' \
  | LC_ALL=C sort
bin/fm-test-run.sh --check-coverage
```

A per-script timeout still allows the runner to write its artifact, but an enclosing step or job cancellation can prevent that write.
Pick runs where every serial shard is green: failed or timeout durations are not healthy packing measurements.
Measure native-Windows-only scripts through the focused Git Bash runner and retain that `duration_ms` separately, because the portable CI shards skip them.

## Coverage guard

`bin/fm-test-run.sh --check-coverage` verifies that both parallel lanes partition the proven-isolated set.
It also verifies that the parallel lanes, portable serial lane, and real-Herdr family are disjoint and cover every `tests/*.test.sh` script.
It separately verifies that the portable serial CI shards are non-empty, disjoint, and together equal the portable serial lane.
It reports the unmeasured serial share as `serial_unhinted=` and refuses when that share exceeds `PORTABLE_SERIAL_MAX_UNHINTED_PERCENT`, so the shards stay balanced on evidence rather than on the default weight.

## Timing artifacts

Portable shards, each portable serial shard, and the Herdr lane upload runner-generated timing JSON.
`bin/fm-test-run.sh --aggregate-json` creates the combined summary artifact.
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` owns the exact artifact names and aggregation wiring.

## Local entry points

[CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) owns the local test policy and common entry points.
`bin/fm-test-run.sh --help` owns exact lane names, selection flags, and bounded `--jobs` mechanics.

## Timeouts

| Lane | Bound | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| portable parallel 1/2 | See [CI workflow](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) | The workflow owns the parallel cap rationale and its evidence limits. |
| portable serial 1-5 | See [CI workflow](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) | On 2026-09-29 the lane measured about 108 minutes of script time with `tests/fm-watch-triage.test.sh` alone about 15 minutes, and the slowest shard ran past 27 minutes; the job cap remains a hang tripwire while leaving margin for job setup and runner-speed spread, and the step budget exceeds twice the measured green shard p90. |
| Herdr | family-run step bound and job backstop in the [CI workflow](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) | Healthy runs finished around 7 minutes before this lane gained `fm-backend-herdr-focus-flash-e2e`, which measures about 2 minutes against a real lab locally; the step budget exceeds twice the measured green p90, so the step bound is still the hang tripwire (cleanup and timing artifacts still upload) while the job cap stays a last-resort backstop. Refresh this figure from the lane's uploaded timing artifact. |

Timeouts are intended as hang tripwires; a passing coverage guard does not establish a healthy job duration.
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` owns the exact numbers.

The [CI workflow](../.github/workflows/ci.yml) enables the runner's measured per-script bounds and shared step budget with reporting margin in every behavior lane, including stock-macOS compatibility.
[`bin/fm-test-run.sh`](../bin/fm-test-run.sh)'s header and `--help` own timeout mechanics; `per_script_timeout_auto_secs` owns the measured bound table and its provenance.
Refresh an entry from the timing artifacts whenever a script's slowest healthy run approaches its bound, the same way the shard hints are refreshed.

## Infrastructure flake retry

The workflow enables the runner's opt-in process-level infrastructure retry in every behavior lane.
The runner's header and `--help` own eligibility and log markers; its JSON writer owns timing fields.
[`tests/fm-test-run.test.sh`](../tests/fm-test-run.test.sh) covers process outcomes, recorded-exit retry vetoes during stream-draining timeouts, shared serial budgets, and stock-Bash final-attempt counts and failure transcripts.
Use the labeled logs, step summaries, and timing artifacts to count retries across runs rather than losing that evidence in manual reruns.
